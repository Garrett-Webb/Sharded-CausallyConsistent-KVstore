# Sharded Causally Consistent Key Value Store
Done as part of a class project

* `Garrett Webb`
* `Kai Hsieh`
* `Rahul Arora`

## Team Contributions:
* `all together:`  We worked on the entire project together over a call with Visual Studio Code Live Share enabled. This allowed us to all look at and modify the same files. This included group debugging and talking over the ideas and implementation as a group. We alternated the roles of who would code while the others watched and helped. All work described below was done by the individual with the team supporting.

* `Garrett:` Developed majority of helper endpoints. With the help of my groupmates, I added the helper endpoints for the sharding operations, helper endpoints, and modified the keyvalue store functionality to operate in a sharded manner. Also helped with the documentation and creation of resharding mechanism.

* `Rahul:` Derived logic for reshard. Determined what data structures to use for storing shards and shard information. Developed vector clock logic. Coded alongside Garrett and Kai using VSCode Live Share. 

* `Kai:` Setup the testing/debugging routine and performed all of the testings. Started the initial key-value-store-view operation which built the base structure for rest of the request handling.
